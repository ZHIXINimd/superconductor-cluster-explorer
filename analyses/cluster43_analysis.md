# Cluster 43 Analysis


### 1) SUMMARY TABLE

| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1       | 66          | Cu (100%), O (100%), Sr (62%), Ba (59%), Ca (57%) | 24â€“143 | 88.85 | U3: 100% | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; Hg-based superconductors dominate |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together:
The compounds in this cluster are unified as hole-doped copper oxide superconductors, specifically belonging to the family of mercury-based cuprates. These materials share common structural motifs such as layered structures with CuO2 planes, which are critical to their superconducting properties. The presence of barium, strontium, and calcium suggests a structure where these elements form reservoir layers that facilitate charge transfer to the CuO2 planes. The crystallographic structures typically exhibit quasi-2D planes conducive to high-temperature superconductivity. The covalent bonding within the CuO2 planes, augmented by charge reservoir layers, enhances the electron mobility necessary for superconductivity. Electron-phonon coupling, though weak in cuprates, might still play a role alongside strong electronic correlations. The presence of mercury introduces volatility that can affect Tc but is essential for the highest Tc values within this cluster.

### 3) Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges):
The parent compounds for this cluster are often Hg-based cuprates like HgBa2Can-1CunO2n+2. Common doping sites include substitutions at the Hg, Ba/Sr, or Ca positions with elements like Pb, Bi, Tl, and transition metals (e.g., Ti, Mo). Doping trends show that substitution at the Hg site with Pb and Bi can enhance the critical temperature, evidenced by compounds reaching up to 143 K. Optimal doping is often near stoichiometries like Hg0.8Pb0.2. In settings where substituents are varied, a change in the valence state of the copper planes might correlate with the stabilities achieved by the reservoir layers. Electron doping via such substitutions leads to increased Tc, with an optimal range typically correlating with the enhancement of the electronic and crystallographic properties. These results emphasize hole doping, given the nature of the cuprate layers.

### 4) Design hints:
Future exploration of higher Tc superconductors in this family might focus on optimizing the Hg substitution levels and identifying new dopants that enhance electron mobility while maintaining structural stability. Experimentation could involve further substituting Sr/Ba/Ca layers to fine-tune the inter-layer spacing and charge transfer efficiency between the CuO2 planes and the charge reservoir layers. Consider exploring combinations that maintain or increase the plane spacing, potentially improving Tc by altering the interaction strengths within the planes.
