| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements          | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes                                              |

| 1       | 55          | Y (100%), Ba (100%), Cu (100%), O (100%), Ni (96%) | 20.5â€“91.6   | 67.95       | U3: 100%            | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; YBCO-like structures   |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together

The cluster primarily consists of YBaCuO-type compounds, frequently known as YBCO, which are well-established high-temperature superconductors characterized by their layered perovskite structures. These structures exhibit quasi-two-dimensional CuO\(_2\) planes that are crucial for superconductivity. The presence of dopants such as nickel subtly alters the structure but retains the essential superconducting planes. The high frequency of elements Y, Ba, Cu, and O highlights the prevalent YBa\(_2\)Cu\(_3\)O\(_7\)-like framework. The chemical bonding is a mixture of covalent and ionic character, with corner-sharing CuO\(_2\) squares and charge reservoir layers that help maintain a mixed valence state conducive to superconductivity. The electronic structure is dominated by the high density of states near the Fermi level within the CuO\(_2\) planes, advantageous for conducting electrons. Additionally, these compounds share a similar level of hole-doping, crucial for their superconductive properties.

### 3) Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)

The parent system in this cluster is the well-known YBa\(_2\)Cu\(_3\)O\(_7\) with various substitutions at copper sites, primarily with nickel, and occasionally silver or platinum. Nickel doping of YBa\(_2\)Cu\(_3\)O\(_7\) generally results in a gradual decrease in Tc as the concentration of nickel increases, highlighting the sensitivity of Tc to changes in Cu-site composition. For instance, replacing copper with a small amount of nickel (up to \(\approx\) 0.15) maintains higher Tc values (~86 K) but further increase leads to decreased Tc. This suggests minimal nickel doping is tolerated before detrimental effects on superconductivity become apparent. No significant electron doping was identified; hole doping remains dominant. Optimal doping levels are near minimal dopant concentrations, specifically around x=0.02 for Ni to keep Tc > 86 K.

### 4) Design hints

For exploring new candidates within this family, look for minimal doping with transition metals other than Cu to improve or maintain superconducting Tc without destabilizing the structural framework. Consider slight variations in oxygen content to investigate potential enhancements in Tc by potentially altering hole carrier concentration. Optimally, maintain the quasi 2D CuO\(_2\) plane integrity and its crystallographic coordination to support high Tc superconductivity effectively.
