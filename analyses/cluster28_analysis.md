### 1) SUMMARY TABLE

| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 55 | Y (100%), Ba (100%), Cu (100%), Co (93%), O (100%) | 21–94.3 | 62.0 | U3: 100% | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; YBCO-like structures with Co/Ni doping |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together

- **Structural Analysis**: The compounds in this cluster predominantly possess a layered perovskite-type structure characteristic of hole-doped cuprate superconductors. Specifically, they are modifications of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO), indicating identical crystallographic frameworks with quasi-2D copper-oxide planes as the principal structural motif. These layers play a crucial role in facilitating superconductivity.

- **Chemical Bonding**: The bonding within these materials is largely covalent with strong ionic character in the Cu-O layers. The copper-oxide (Cu-O) planes serve as the conducting layers, while the BaO and Y layers function as charge reservoirs, sustaining optimal carrier concentration necessary for superconductivity. Mixed valence states of Cu are vital for charge transfer processes that regulate Tc.

- **Electronic Structure**: The electronic properties are defined by the density of states around the Fermi level, with hole carriers being predominant. The d-electron count of Cu and planar Cu-O bonds is significant for the electron pairing mechanism, while the extent of CuO2 plane doping determines the band filling and nesting conditions necessary for high Tc.

- **Compositional Patterns**: The stoichiometry typically follows Y:Ba:Cu ratios and involves minor Co/Ni doping at the Cu site. These interstitial elements influence Tc via pair-breaking and scattering mechanisms. Aliovalent substitutions through cobalt and nickel subtly modify electron correlations vital in the high-Tc regime.

- **Physical Property Correlations**: The critical temperature largely correlates with the oxygen stoichiometry and the extent of Co/Ni substitution, with the highest Tc observed close to full oxygenation.

- **Mechanistic Hypothesis**: The superconducting mechanism is likely governed by a combination of strong electron correlations and d-wave pairing symmetry. The structural and electronic configurations favor spin fluctuation-mediated pairing, which aligns with the behaviors seen in other high-Tc cuprate superconductors.

### 3) Doping analysis

- **Parent Systems**: YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) is the primary parent compound.

- **Trends**: Substitution of Co/Ni at the Cu site generally leads to suppression of Tc due to increased scattering from magnetic impurities. However, small concentrations can enhance Tc by altering planar charge distribution.

- **Optimal Ranges**: The optimal doping occurs at low (~0.03–0.05) Co/Ni substitutions. A marked decrease in Tc is observed beyond this, indicating a strong sensitivity to doping levels and the delicate balance between structural order and electronic interactions.

- **Doping Types**: The cluster exhibits primarily hole doping, with Co/Ni changing the electronic structure and influencing carrier concentration beneficial for superconductivity.

### 4) Design hints

- Focus on optimizing Co/Ni substitution levels, particularly keeping them low to prevent Tc suppression via excess disorder.
- Emphasize control over the oxygen content to maintain high Tc values, ensuring samples are near-optimal oxygenation.
- Investigate the potential for alternative transition metal substitutions with similar ionic radii but non-magnetic characteristics to enhance Tc without significant scattering.
