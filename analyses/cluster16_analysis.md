### 2) Why this cluster groups together

**Structural Analysis**: The majority of the compounds in this cluster belong to the iron pnictide family, characterized by layered iron arsenide (FeAs) structures. The stacking of these layers results in a quasi-two-dimensional structure that is common among these compounds. The presence of perovskite-like layers in the A15 intermetallics contributes to dimensional layering and coordination commonalities.

**Chemical Bonding**: These compounds exhibit mixed metallic and covalent bonding typical of iron-based superconductors. The iron atoms form strong covalent bonds with arsenic, while ionic character is introduced through alkali and alkaline-earth metal doping, serving as charge reservoirs. The A15 intermetallics show predominantly metallic bonding characteristics with niobium-based networks.

**Electronic Structure**: The clustering is strongly associated with d-electron character from transition metals like iron and niobium. The compounds often demonstrate electron-photon coupling and possible spin fluctuation mediation, which are conducive to superconductivity. In iron pnictides, the doping enhances or modifies the Fermi surface for optimal superconductivity.

**Compositional Patterns**: The majority of the compounds display common 2:1:2 stoichiometry in alkali/alkaline-earth metal doping with the FeAs layers, synonymous with 122-type iron pnictides, combined with specific Nb3X type compositions among the A15 class.

**Physical Property Correlations**: Generally, higher Tc values correlate with specific stoichiometries and doping levels, particularly seen in iron pnictides. These compositions display an optimal balance of electron/hole doping which is crucial for superconductivity in these materials.

**Mechanistic Hypothesis**: This cluster likely follows an unconventional superconducting mechanism, with a prominent role for spin fluctuations in iron pnictides, alongside possible conventional mechanisms in the A15 phases. The evidence of d-wave or s± pairing symmetry is suggested by the shared electronic structure characteristics and doping modulation.

### 3) Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)

- **Main Parent Systems**: BaFe2As2, SrFe2As2, CaFe2As2, and related structures with substitutions like K, Co, Ni, Rh, and P.
- **Doping Trends**: 
  - **Hole Doping (e.g., K for Ba/Sr/Ca)**: Generally enhances Tc up to an optimal level before over-doping decreases Tc.
  - **Electron Doping (e.g., Co/Ni for Fe)**: Moderate increases in Tc with some compositions and provides fine control (often some optimal Co concentration near 0.1–0.2).
- **Optimal Doping Range**: Typically around K~0.3-0.4, P~0.5 for maximizing Tc, with occasional Ni or Co substitutions.
- **Under-doped vs Optimally-doped vs Over-doped**: Optimal Tc achieved in the K-doping vicinity of ~0.3-0.4, while over-doping reduces superconducting properties.

### 4) Design hints

- For exploring new candidates, focus on optimizing the doping levels of alkali metals like K or Na in the buffers and transition metal substitutions like Co or Ni within the FeAs layers.
- Explore further variations in mixed-valency cation systems to potentially uncover higher Tc pairs, particularly focusing on elements that can introduce heterogeneity or induce variable valence states in the FeAs layers.
- Investigate structural variants where subtle layering differences or interlayer spacings may enable better carrier transport or electron pairing symmetries.
