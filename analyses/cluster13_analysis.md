# Cluster 13 Analysis


### 1) SUMMARY TABLE

| Cluster  | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements                               | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes                                |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Cluster 1 | 60          | Cu (100%), O (100%), Ba (100%), Er (28%), Tm (20%) | 20–95.1      | 80.72       | U3: 100%            | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; RE-123 structures |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together:

The cluster primarily consists of REBa₂Cu₃Oᵪ compounds (RE = rare earth, e.g., Er, Ho, Tm, Dy), which are part of the high-temperature superconductor family known as the 123 cuprates. These materials cluster due to shared structural motifs, specifically the quasi-2D layered structure with copper-oxide planes crucial for superconductivity. They exhibit perovskite-like block arrangements wherein the CuO₂ planes are separated by rare earth and barium layers, allowing for efficient coupling of charge carriers. The bonding is predominantly covalent in the CuO₂ planes, with a charge reservoir role played by the RE and Ba ions that modulate carrier density. Electronically, these compounds are characterized by d-band structures with strong electron correlations, often resulting in hole-doped mechanisms where superconductivity arises from cooper pairing mediated potentially by spin fluctuations.

### 3) Doping analysis:

- **Parent Systems**: The parent compounds primarily follow the formula REBa₂Cu₃O₇₋δ, where δ typically varies to adjust oxygen content, effectively controlling hole doping.
- **Tc Trends with Doping Level**: Optimal doping occurs near full oxygenation at O~7, where Tc peaks, generally decreasing as oxygen is delicately reduced. Examples include: 
  - Dy1Ba2Cu3O7 shows highest Tc near full oxygenation.
  - Tm1Ba2Cu3O7 exhibits similar trends, optimizing around 92.1 K at high oxygen stoichiometry.
- **Overdoped vs Underdoped Regimes**: Decreasing oxygen more significantly (increasing δ) results in lower Tc, indicating the underdoped regime undermines superconductivity due to insufficient hole concentration.

### 4) Design hints:

To explore new candidates within these cuprate superconductors, focusing on maximizing oxygen content near 7 is key for peak Tc. Consider substituting different rare earth elements while maintaining charge balance, investigating mixed rare earth content for potential cooperative effects on superconductivity. Also, examine the impact of substituting Sr for Ba or tweaking the copper stoichiometry marginally, as these could offer fine control over carrier density or structural dimensions supporting higher Tc.
