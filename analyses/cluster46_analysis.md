# Cluster46 Analysis


### 1) SUMMARY TABLE

| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1       | 107         | Bi (91%), Pb (86%), Sr (82%), Ca (82%), Cu (82%) | 24.8-122 | 77.2  | U3: 100% | Mainly hole-doped bismuth cuprates; presence of Tl, Pb substitutions |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together

This cluster of compounds is grouped primarily by their structural and compositional features, displaying the common motifs of hole-doped bismuth-based cuprate superconductors. Structurally, they typically feature layered perovskite-like units with CuO\(_2\) planes, which are characteristic of high-Tc superconductors. The presence of Bi and Pb often indicates a Bi\(_2\)Sr\(_2\)CaCu\(_2\)O\(_8\) (BSCCO) type structure, with lead substitution or doping as a method to modify the electronic properties and Tc. These structures are quasi-two-dimensional with stacking layers that are effective in facilitating superconductivity via charge transfer between the CuO\(_2\) planes. Chemical bonding is characterized by ionic and covalent aspects, with the charge-reservoir layers composed of (Bi,Pb)-O influencing the doping levels in the Cu-O conducting planes. Electronically, these compounds are known to exhibit d-wave pairing symmetry common in high-temperature superconductors, driven by strong electron correlations and anisotropic band structures. The clustering is likely due to these structural, electronic, and compositional similarities, specifically the BSCCO type framework with various doping strategies that help optimize superconducting properties.

### 3) Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)

The parent systems within this cluster include common bismuth-based cuprates such as Bi\(_2\)Sr\(_2\)CaCu\(_2\)O\(_8\) and their variations with lead substitutions (e.g., Bi\(_{2-x}\)Pb\(_x\)Sr\(_2\)CaCu\(_2\)O\(_8\)). The primary doping mechanism appears to involve the substitution of Pb in the Bi sites, as well as controlled variations in Sr, Ca, and Cu site stoichiometries. Tc generally increases with the optimized Pb doping levels around x ~ 0.3 to 0.4, with excessive substitution leading to a more metallic state that suppresses Tc. The presence of other elements like Nd and Y introduced in small amounts typically represent minor alterations that fine-tune Tc by further modifying hole concentrations. The optimal doping for maintaining higher Tc often aligns with maintaining CuO\(_2\) plane integrity, where excessive deviation is seen to suppress superconductivity possibly due to induced structural instabilities or charge imbalance.

### 4) Design hints

To explore new candidates within this family, focus should be on:
- Fine-tuning p-type doping by controlled substitution of Bi with Pb, maintaining a balance to enhance the superconducting properties without destabilizing the structure.
- Exploring other potential substituents in the Sr and Ca sites that can offer new pathways for inducing charge carriers effectively while preserving the firm scaffolding necessary for high-Tc.
- Investigating the impact of co-doping with transitional metals and rare-earth elements, taking into account their atomic radius and electronic properties to enhance Tc.
- Balancing Bi-based stability with the introduction of additional compositional modifications aimed at enhancing the CuO\(_2\) plane conductivity and pairing interactions.
