### 2) Why this cluster groups together

**Structural Analysis:** The compounds in this cluster are predominantly magnesium diboride (MgB2)-based, which is characterized by a hexagonal AlB2-type structure. This structural motif features layers of magnesium atoms sandwiched between hexagonal boron layers in a quasi-2D configuration. The boron atoms form a honeycomb lattice which is crucial for their superconducting properties.

**Chemical Bonding:** The bonding in MgB2 has a complex interplay between metallic and covalent character, largely driven by the electrons from Mg and the p-orbitals from B. The characteristic B-B covalent bonds in the layer contribute significantly to the electronic properties, while Mg donates electrons, increasing the metallic character.

**Electronic Structure:** MgB2 is a conventional superconductor with strong electron-phonon coupling. The d-band filling is not significantly altered in doped variants, but heterovalent substitution adjusts the carrier concentration. The introduction of doping elements affects the electron-phonon coupling and can modify the density of states near the Fermi level. Superconductivity in MgB2 is believed to be driven by the coupling between the boron-derived σ bands and phonons.

**Compositional Patterns:** Most compounds involve substitution on the magnesium site with various metals (e.g., Al, Li, Zn) or slight modification of boron composition through carbon doping. These substitutions are guided by isovalent as well as aliovalent changes, which can enhance or suppress superconductivity.

**Physical Property Correlations:** Higher Tc values are typically maintained when the predominant structural motif is preserved. Critical temperature tends to decline with excessive carbon substitution or too significant deviation from the stoichiometry around MgB2.

**Mechanistic Hypothesis:** The superconducting mechanism in MgB2 and its variants is primarily phonon-mediated as predicted by the BCS theory. The structural and chemical consistencies in this cluster align with strong electron-phonon coupling typically seen in conventional superconductors.

### 3) Doping analysis

- **Parent Systems**: MgB2 is the main parent compound, with various elements such as Al, Li, Zn, and C employed as dopants.
- **Trends**: 
  - Al-doping shows a decrease in Tc beyond optimal concentrations.
  - Li substitution often increases Tc marginally, stabilizing around moderate doping levels.
  - Carbon substitution typically suppresses Tc if beyond a certain level due to disruption in boron layers.
- **Optimal Doping**: 
  - Al: Optimal at low levels, peaking around ~3-5% substitution.
  - Li: Peaks at around 7-10% doping without significant suppression.
- **Under/Overdoped Regimes**: Excess doping in both Al and carbon can lead to a decline in Tc as the electron-phonon coupling weakens.

### 4) Design hints

- Focus on preserving the hexagonal boron layer structure; minimal disturbance in the layer can enhance Tc.
- Investigate hybrid doping with aliovalent substitutions (duals like Al/Li) for fine-tuning electronic properties.
- Perform detailed studies on phonon modes in modified compounds to find configurations with enhanced electron-phonon interactions.
- Ensure stoichiometric balance around MgB2, especially in co-doped systems, to maintain structural integrity.
