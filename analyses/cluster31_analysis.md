### 1) SUMMARY TABLE

| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |

### 2) **Why this cluster groups together**

The compounds in this cluster group together primarily due to their shared structural and compositional characteristics as hole-doped cuprate superconductors. These compounds typically have layered perovskite-like structures with copper-oxygen planes that are critical for superconductivity. The presence of barium and yttrium (or other rare earth elements) provides a charge reservoir, facilitating hole-doping in the copper-oxygen layers. The structural motif is characterized by alternating layers of conducting CuO2 planes and insulating layers containing rare earth and alkaline earth metals. This quasi-two-dimensional structure promotes the high-Tc superconductivity observed in these materials. The bonding within CuO2 layers is predominantly covalent with some ionic character provided by the interactions between charges in different layers. Charge transfer within these layers adjusts the electron density near the Fermi level, contributing to superconductivity. These materials typically exhibit strong electron correlations and work within a d-wave pairing mechanism.

### 3) **Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)**

- **Parent Systems**: Variations of YBa2Cu3O7-x-like structures.
- **Doping Trends**: Substitution of different rare earth elements (RE) such as Nd, Eu, Tm, Er, and Pr into YBaCuO structures tends to adjust hole concentration in CuO2 planes, impacting Tc values. For example, increasing oxygen deficiency (x) often leads to reduced Tc due to a decrease in carrier concentration.
- **Optimal Ranges**: Optimal doping is achieved when there is a balance sufficient to maintain maximum hole concentration without over/under doping; specific optimal doping levels depend on slight changes in oxygen content, e.g., YBa2Cu3O6.9–7 shows high Tc.
- **Electron/Hole Doping**: Predominantly hole doping is responsible for achieving superconductivity across this cluster.

### 4) **Design hints**

For exploring new candidates in this family, consider:
- Investigating further rare earth substitutions within the (RE)BaCuO family to tune carrier concentration.
- Exploring dual doping or more complex multi-element doping strategies that stabilize the crystal structure while optimizing the hole density in CuO2 planes.
- Experimenting with varying oxygen content precisely to find optimal superconducting phases while ensuring structural integrity.
- Extending studies to thin-film forms where strain and controlled layering might enhance Tc.
