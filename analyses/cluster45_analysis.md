| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1       | 97          | Cu (100%), O (100%), Ba (100%), Y (83%), Fe (78%) | 20.5–91.8 | 65.5 | U3: 95%, U4: 5% | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; YBCO-like structures |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together
The compounds in this cluster group together primarily due to their structural and compositional similarities, typical of YBCO-like hole-doped cuprate superconductors. These materials generally feature a layered perovskite structure composed of copper-oxygen planes which are essential for the superconducting properties. The structure typically includes alternating conducting Cu-O planes and charge reservoir layers composed mainly of yttrium and barium oxides. These layers provide charge transfer necessary for carrier mobility. The shared use of elements like Cu, O, Ba, and Y, and doping variations involving other metals like Fe and Co, maintain a consistent framework that allows for high-temperature superconductivity. The prevalent presence of d-electrons on copper and Fermi surface nesting are hallmarks of these cuprates, enhancing electron-phonon coupling and promoting superconductivity.

### 3) Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)
Parent systems can be identified as YBa2Cu3O7−δ structures with various transition metal substitutions (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Ga). The doped variants primarily show Fe-doping within the Cu-O layers, which tends to decrease Tc systematically as the doping level increases from x=0.02 to x=0.20. The optimal doping range is typically at lower substitution levels (x=0.01-x=0.05) for Fe, where Tc approaches its maximum around 91K. Beyond this range, Fe insertion causes a reduction in Tc, likely due to pair-breaking effects or structural distortions. For Ga and Ni, similar trends appear, indicating that hole doping primarily dominates. Doping modifies the hole concentration in the Cu-O planes, affecting Tc, with optimally doped compounds having partial oxygen depletion (δ) that balances copper oxidation states.

### 4) Design hints
To explore new candidates, consider compounds with slight variations in the doping levels of Cu-O planes while maintaining structural stability—the introduction of ions with similar sizes but varied valence states could help balance charge without disrupting the lattice too much. Maintaining a bi-layer Cu-O structure will be crucial. Focus on substituents that modulate the electron-phonon coupling or induce low levels of strain in the lattice, potentially enhancing Tc. Explorations into reducing oxygen content systematically alongside selective doping could unveil new superconducting phases.
