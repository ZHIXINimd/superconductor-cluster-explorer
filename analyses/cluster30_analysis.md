# Cluster 30 Analysis


### 1) SUMMARY TABLE
| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1       | 143         | Cu (100%), O (100%), Ba (100%), Ca (80%), Y (75%) | 20.3–87 | 64.5 | U3: 100% | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; YBCO-like structures |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together
The compounds in this cluster exhibit shared motifs typical of hole-doped cuprate superconductors. They possess layered structures with copper-oxide (CuO2) planes separated by layers that include ions such as Y, Ba, Ca, and sometimes La or other rare-earth elements. These structures are derived from the well-known YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) family. The presence of CuO2 planes is crucial as they form the conducting layers where superconductivity occurs. Chemically, these setups involve a mix of covalent Cu-O bonds within the planes and more ionic character in the layers separating them. Electronically, d-electron count variations in elements like Cu, along with other oxygen stoichiometries, facilitate control over the carrier concentration leading to high-temperature superconductivity that arises from strong electron correlations and possible d-wave pairing.

### 3) Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)
- **Parent compounds and common doping:** The YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) system dominates, with dopants such as Ca, Pr, and La. Doping typically involves substitution of these elements into the Y, Ba, or Cu sites.
- **Tc trends:** Doping with Ca typically increases Tc initially, but past a certain substitution level, the Tc decreases, indicating optimum doping. For Pr doping, Tc varies based on concentration and often decreases as Pr content goes high.
- **Doping ratio effects:** Optimal Ca substitution is around 5-10% with a peak Tc near 85 K. Overdoping or excessive substitution leads to a rapid Tc reduction.
- **Doping type:** Typically hole doping dominates in YBCO family as CuO2 planes act as layers accepting added hole carriers.
- **Optimal doping:** Observed optimum doping ranges are x ≈ 0.1–0.2 for Ca, with peak Tc noted for such levels. When Pr is introduced, careful balance is crucial to maintain high Tc.
- **Regime identification:** Optimal doping corresponds to the highest achievable Tc before additional substitution leads to a drop in superconducting properties.

### 4) Design hints
For exploration of new candidates within this family, incorporating elements like Ca to substitute for Y maintains high Tc with YBCO-type structural integrity. Focus on keeping optimal doping levels for maximum effectiveness, developing Ca-rich variants still within the stability range before structural distortion impacts Tc adversely. Consider slight Pr doping for modulating electronic properties while monitoring for possible Tc suppression. Consider exploring stoichiometry variations maintaining the CuO2 planar integrity to achieve enhancements.
