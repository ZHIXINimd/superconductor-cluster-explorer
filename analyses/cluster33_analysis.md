### 2) Why this cluster groups together

**Structural Analysis:** The compounds in this cluster predominantly belong to the cuprate family, specifically YBa₂Cu₃O₇-δ (YBCO-like structures), characterized by layered perovskite blocks. These structures are quasi-2D with alternating layers that facilitate high-temperature superconductivity, featuring CuO₂ planes and charge reservoir layers—critical for their superconducting properties.

**Chemical Bonding:** The bonding within these materials involves a mix of covalent and ionic interactions, primarily in the Cu-O planes responsible for superconductivity, coupled with the ionic character from the rare-earth and alkaline-earth elements. The layered nature with Ba and Y acting as charge reservoirs enhances electron-hole pairs essential for superconductivity.

**Electronic Structure:** The electronic properties stem from d-electron interactions within Cu-O planes, and the high Tc is attributed to strong electron correlations and significant electronic anisotropy. Charge transfer mechanisms between CuO₂ layers and reservoirs play a critical role, often mediated by hole doping, which is a dominant feature in these compounds.

**Compositional Patterns:** The presence of Y, Ba, Cu, and O is consistent with typical 1:2:3 stoichiometry seen in YBCO compounds, while substitution of Ga into Cu sites represents aliovalent doping affecting Tc. The introduction of Ga (and occasionally In) changes hole concentration, affecting superconductivity.

**Physical Property Correlations:** The Tc variation correlates with the Ga doping level, and the structural integrity of CuO₂ planes is crucial. Optimal Tc is often linked to specific Cu-O bond distances and planar configurations that favor large density of states at the Fermi level.

**Mechanistic Hypothesis:** These compounds likely exhibit d-wave pairing symmetry, characterized by strong Cu-O plane electron couplings and spin fluctuation mediation. The evidence aligns with known high-Tc cuprate behavior, supporting unconventional superconductivity models.

### 3) Doping analysis

- **Parent Systems:** YBa₂Cu₃O₇ with Ga and In doping replacing Cu.
- **Doping Sites:** Ga and In typically substitute Cu in the CuO₂ planes.
- **Tc Trends:** Ga doping generally decreases Tc as more Cu is replaced, owing to the disruption of the superconductive planes. In doping maintains higher Tc, suggesting limited impact on plane integrity.
- **Doping Ratio Effects:** Tc decreases as Ga content increases, with an apparent critical point around Ga ~0.3. In contrast, at low substitutions, Tc appears less affected.
- **Dominant Type:** Hole doping dominates, as hole concentration in the CuO₂ plane is crucial for superconductive behavior.
- **Optimal Range/Critical Ratios:** Ga doping around 0 to 0.03 seems to maintain higher Tc (~90 K). Beyond this, Tc declines steadily.

### 4) Design hints

- To explore new candidates, consider maintaining or increasing hole concentration in CuO₂ planes.
- Experiment with controlled minimal doping to impact Tc mildly, possibly exploring alternative lower-impact dopants.
- Maintain the structural planarity of CuO₂, avoiding excessive elemental substitution that may distort key superconductive geometry.
