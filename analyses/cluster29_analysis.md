### 2) Why this cluster groups together
This cluster groups together due to shared structural and chemical characteristics typical of hole-doped cuprate superconductors, specifically YBCO-related compounds. The dominant structural motif comprises layered perovskite units with alternating layers of CuO2 planes, which are central to superconductivity in these materials. The Y, Ba, and Ca elements are found within the perovskite structure, facilitating hole doping through cation substitution, primarily on Y and Cu sites. Chemically, these materials exhibit a mixed metal oxide nature with strong covalent Cu-O bonding, which underpins the 2D conductivity in the CuO2 planes. Electronic structure analysis suggests d-electron mediation and potential charge transfer between layers, driving the superconducting mechanism. Compositional variation via element substitution (e.g., Co for Cu, Ni addition) shows systematic trends affecting Tc. This coherence is reinforced by their collective exhibition of high critical temperatures within a narrow range facilitated by similar electronic properties such as band filling and a consistent charge reservoir/loading mechanism.

### 3) Doping analysis
- **Main Parent Systems**: The parental system seems to be YBa2Cu3O7-d (YBCO-type), with prevalent doping observed at Cu sites.
- **Doping Sites**: Primarily Cu sites are doped, with Co being a common substitute. Some variants include Ni and slight Ca doping.
- **Tc Trends with Doping Level**: Tc generally decreases with increased Co content beyond 15%. Optimal superconductivity is observed when Co content is lower (below ~15%, ranges from ~86K down to ~51K when Co content is maximized to ~0.45). Ni doping also shows decreased Tc, peaking around ~82K but decreasing beyond ~0.1 doping.
- **Doping Ratio Effects**: Overdoped regimes (>15% Co or Ni doping) significantly suppress Tc, indicating the crucial balance needed between carrier concentration and planar structure integrity. 
- **Electron vs Hole Doping**: Predominantly hole doping is achieved through variation in cations, especially the substitution of smaller or isovalent cations (like Y/Ca, Ba/Sr).
- **Optimal Doping**: Slight Co doping (~0.15) appears beneficial for maintaining near-maximum Tc while too much disrupts the critical plane connectivity, plummeting superconductivity efficacy.

### 4) Design hints
To explore new candidates within this cluster, consider:
- **Substitution at Low Concentrations**: Investigate small, controlled substitutions at the Cu and Ba sites to fine-tune Tc optimally without disrupting the critical CuO2 plane integrity.
- **Elemental Doping Combos**: Consider dual-element substitution strategies where the trade-off between effective charge carrier concentration and structural stability around the CuO2 planes remains optimized.
- **Incorporate Light Elements**: Light elements like Li, which can act as interstitial dopants, could modulate the hole densities, potentially stabilizing higher Tc within the same structural framework.
- **Examine Pressure Effects**: Apply modest pressure to these compounds to observe shifts in Tc, as compressive strain could modulate planar interactions favorably.
