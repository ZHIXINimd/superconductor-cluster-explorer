### 2) **Why this cluster groups together**

The compounds in this cluster are grouped together primarily because they are all high-temperature superconductors belonging to the hole-doped cuprate family, specifically the Y-based cuprates (YBa2Cu3O7 or YBCO) with Pr substitutions. The shared structural motif is the layered perovskite-like CuO2 planes that are characteristic of cuprates. The crystal structure generally involves conducting CuO2 planes separated by charge reservoir layers composed of BaO and Y/PrO. The substitution of Pr into the Y site impacts the electronic structure, particularly affecting hole concentration and the superconducting transition temperature (\(T_c\)).

- **Structural Analysis**: All compounds possess a layered perovskite structure with quasi-2D CuO2 planes, responsible for superconductivity. The Y/Pr sites typically maintain a similar lattice with possible orthorhombic to slightly tetragonal variations depending on oxygen doping levels.
- **Chemical Bonding**: The bonding has strong mixed ionic/covalent characteristics, with significant Cu-O covalent interactions within planes. Pr substitution retains Y's stoichiometric role but adds complexity to the valence state landscape, affecting superconductivity.
- **Electronic Structure**: The presence of CuO2 planes provides a high density of states at the Fermi level, crucial for superconductivity. Pr doping leads to modification of the hole concentration in these planes. The compounds are hole-doped, affecting the \(T_c\) significantly with varying Pr content.
- **Compositional Patterns**: The clustering is driven by the systematic substitution of Pr at the Y site and modifications of oxygen stoichiometry, following common YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) trends. The oxygen content plays a role in controlling the superconducting properties by affecting the valence states.
- **Physical Property Correlations**: Higher \(T_c\) values correlate with optimized oxygen content. The drop in \(T_c\) with increased Pr doping suggests a disruption in optimal hole doping.
- **Mechanistic Hypothesis**: Superconductivity is likely driven by strong electron-phonon interactions characteristic of cuprates, with potential additional contributions from magnetic spin fluctuation due to the presence of Cu. The \(d\)-wave pairing symmetry is expected, as frequently observed in cuprates.

### 3) **Doping analysis**

The primary parent system in this cluster is YBa2Cu3O7, with extensive Pr doping studied at the Y site:
- With increasing Pr content, \(T_c\) shows a decreasing trend, with optimal \(T_c\) near low Pr concentration.
- Electron doping doesn't appear primary; hole doping via oxygen concentration modulates \(T_c\) alongside Pr.
- Optimal \(T_c\) is observed at low Pr levels (≤ 0.05), with significant suppression beyond 0.2; configurations at higher doping move toward overdoped/non-superconducting.
- Oxygen stoichiometry from YBa2Cu3O7-x plays a vital role; small modifications in x greatly impact \(T_c\).

### 4) **Design hints**

For new candidate designs:
- Explore fine-tuning Pr content around low levels (<0.2) to maximize \(T_c\).
- Investigate oxygen stoichiometry effects, stressing control over oxygen depletion/constant presence to keep YBa2Cu3O7-x optimized.
- Transition to other rare-earth dopants (like Nd) at low concentrations for potential new superconductivity maxima.
- Prioritize maintaining intact CuO2 plane structures with appropriate hole concentrations to retain high superconductivity.
