### 1) SUMMARY TABLE

| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1       | 36          | Ba (100%), Cu (100%), O (100%), Zn (86%), Er (19%) | 21â€“85.1     | 52.5         | U3: 100%               | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; YBCO-like structures |

### 2) **Why this cluster groups together**

These compounds cluster together due to their common structure as hole-doped cuprates, specifically within the category of YBCO-like structures. The shared crystallographic feature is their layered perovskite structure with the presence of copper-oxide planes, which is a hallmark of high-temperature superconductivity in this family. Chemically, these compounds exhibit mixed valence states necessary for superconductivity, specifically involving copper in Cu(+2) and Cu(+3) states, and often include substitutions at chain or plane sites, affecting the hole concentration. Electronically, these materials are characterized by a strong electron correlation and d-wave pairing mechanism, with a superconducting state that arises from the interaction in the copper-oxide planes. Compositionally, they feature substitutions in rare-earth or other cation sites (Er, Dy, Sm, Yb) and other elements like Zn and Fe that modify the superconducting properties.

### 3) **Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)**

The parent systems involve typical YBCO-type structures with Ba and Cu serving as core components, to which Er, Sm, Dy, or Yb are doped. The main doping sites are the Cu sites, where Zn and Fe substitutions occur. Tc generally decreases with increased Zn doping content. For example, there is a decrease observed from nearly optimum doping levels, indicating Zn substitution leads to a suppression of Tc. This suggests an optimal range for Zn content below 0.10. In contrast, Fe co-doping with Zn shows a complex interaction, with Tc not significantly rising above that of undoped counterparts but stabilizing at lower compositions. The compounds mostly experience hole-doping and maintain superconductivity through careful tuning of oxygen content and rare earth substitutions.

### 4) **Design hints**

To explore new candidates within this family, focus on maintaining the integrity of the copper-oxide layers while experimenting with small-scale doping, particularly alternate rare-earth substitutions at low concentrations. Optimize Zn doping levels below 0.10 to maintain high Tc, and explore slight variations in oxygen stoichiometry for optimal hole concentration. Investigate the potential of co-doping strategies that might provide synergistic effects in Tc enhancement, ensuring the balance does not significantly disrupt the Cu-O plane integrity.
