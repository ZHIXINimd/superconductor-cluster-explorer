# Cluster 20 Analysis

### 1) SUMMARY TABLE

| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1       | 118         | Fe (100%), As (100%), O (92%), Sr (25%), Ti (14%) | 20-56.5         | 35.7           | U10: 85%, U11: 10%, C6: 5% | Predominantly 1111-type and 122-type Fe pnictides. Variations with oxygen and transition metal elements. |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together
These compounds cluster together due to the shared structural motif of layered iron-based superconductors typically characterized by alternating layers of iron pnictide or chalcogenide planes interspersed with charge reservoir layers. The common space groups are typically tetragonal (e.g., P4/nmm) reflecting quasi-2D planes. The crystallographic structure features Fe-As or Fe-Ch layers responsible for superconductivity, exhibiting metallic bonding within these layers and ionic/covalent character with the interspersed layers. The electron count and versatility for electron/hole doping make these materials prime targets for exploring high-Tc superconductivity, mainly driven by spin fluctuations and electronic correlations typical of unconventional superconductivity in pnictides and chalcogenides.

### 3) Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)
- Main parent systems: LnFeAsO (where Ln: La, Nd, Sm), BaFe₂As₂, SrFe₂As₂.
- Common doping sites include replacing O with F in the 1111 families or substituting Fe with Co/Ni or Ba/Sr with K/Rb in the 122 families.
- Tc trends show initial increases with doping, peaking around x ≈ 0.1-0.2 for electron doping (e.g., Co), and similar values for hole doping (e.g., K).
- Electron doping is observed to dominate, with Co replacing Fe often leading to optimal Tc values.
- Optimal doping levels tend to peak around x ≈ 0.15, yielding top Tc values before decreasing in the overdoped regimes indicating no further enhancement of superconducting density of states.

### 4) Design hints
- Investigate transition metal substitutions in Fe sites, focusing on Co, Ni, and Cr to modulate carrier concentrations.
- Explore mixed-anion systems, particularly those involving N and F for oxygen.
- Consider varied lanthanide substitutions for more structural flexibility and potential phonon mode adjustments.
- Optimize doping near x ≈ 0.15 for the highest Tc, maintaining sensitivity to interlayer spacing and electronic structure modulations from different dopant sizes and charges.

### 5) ANOMALY TABLE

| Formula | Reason for Flagging |
|---------|---------------------|
| Tl1Fe1.7Se2 | Presence of Tl and Se is atypical for the dominant Fe-As systems. |
| Nb0.7Fe1.55Se1.01S0.99 | Nb and S presence diverges from common elements in this cluster. |
| Th1As1Fe1N1 | Th and N presence suggest variations not central to main Fe/As/O-interlayer themes. |
| Th1Fe1As1 | Unusual inclusion outside of common 122/1111 frameworks. |
| Eu1Fe2Se2 | Not typical for primarily As-based systems, introduction of Se indicates a chalcogenide subgroup. |
