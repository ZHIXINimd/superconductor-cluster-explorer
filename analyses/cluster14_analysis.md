| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements                | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution  | Notes                                                      |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together

**Structural Analysis:** The predominant structural motif in this cluster is the perovskite-like layered arrangement typical of cuprates, especially the La-based hole-doped cuprates (La2-xSrxCuO4). These structures feature CuO2 planes, which are critical for superconductivity, and are typically 2D layered structures. The presence of Ba and Sr suggests the presence of layered perovskite oxides such as YBa2Cu3O7-δ (YBCO), which is a well-known high-Tc superconductor.

**Chemical Bonding:** The compounds primarily exhibit covalent bonding within the CuO2 planes, with some ionic character due to the different cations (La, Sr, Ba). The oxygen content can vary slightly, indicating potential for charge reservoir layers influencing the charge in the CuO2 planes.

**Electronic Structure:** Most compounds suggest p-type conductivity due to hole doping (Sr, Ba). The electronic structure is characterized by a high density of states at the Fermi level, caused by the complexity of the CuO2 plane interactions and the hole doping. Fermi surface features consistent with unconventional superconductivity, such as d-wave pairing, are likely present.

**Compositional Patterns:** The clustering stems from consistent cation doping patterns, such as La replaced by Sr or Ba, affecting the oxygen stoichiometry and optimizing the superconducting Tc. The stoichiometry variations like La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 allow exploration within the same structural motif.

**Physical Property Correlations:** The Tc correlates with the degree of doping—optimal doping levels in La2-xSrxCuO4 maximize Tc. Layer integrity and minimal disorder in CuO2 planes are key for achieving higher Tc.

**Mechanistic Hypothesis:** The superconducting mechanism in this cluster is likely driven by spin fluctuation-mediated pairing and strong electron correlations in the CuO2 planes, typical of high-Tc cuprates.

### 3) Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)

- **Parent Systems:** The primary parent system is La2CuO4, typically doped with Sr, Ba, or Ca to form La2-xAxCuO4 (A = Sr, Ba, Ca).
- **Doping Sites:** Sr and Ba replace La, introducing holes into the CuO2 planes.
- **Tc Trends:** Tc initially increases with Sr doping, reaching a peak around x=0.15 to x=0.2, before decreasing with further doping. Ba doping shows similar trends.
- **Optimal Ranges:** Optimal doping is typically at Sr/Ba=0.15-0.2, with Tc falling in the underdoped or overdoped regimes beyond this range. For YBCO, Y:Ba ratio optimizations lead to even higher Tcs.
- **Electron vs Hole Doping:** Hole doping dominates, positively correlating with Tc up to a point, after which additional doping reduces superconductivity.

### 4) Design hints

To explore new candidates in this family:
- Focus on fine-tuning the doping levels, aiming near optimal x=0.15–0.2 for Sr or Ba in La2CuO4 structures.
- Enhance structural integrity by minimizing disorder in the CuO2 planes.
- Explore new cation substitutions that maintain the planar integrity and valence electron count for potential Tc enhancements.
- Investigate subtle oxygen content adjustments for optimal charge distribution in the CuO2 layers.
