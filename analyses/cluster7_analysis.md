### 2) Why this cluster groups together

**Structural Analysis**: The compounds in this cluster are predominantly composed of YBa\(_2\)Cu\(_3\)O\(_{7-x}\) (YBCO)-like structures, characterized by quasi-2D CuO\(_2\) planes that form the superconducting layers. The crystal structure typically belongs to the orthorhombic system, with a space group of Pmmm. The CuO\(_2\) planes are separated by layers containing rare-earth and alkaline earth metals (Y and Ba), and these layers act as charge reservoirs.

**Chemical Bonding**: The bonding within these structures consists of strongly ionic interactions between the cationic layers (Y, Ba) and the anionic CuO\(_2\) planes. There is significant covalent character in the Cu-O bonds within the CuO\(_2\) planes, which contributes to the crystal's superconducting properties. The presence of mixed valence Cu ions fluctuating between Cu\(^{2+}\) and Cu\(^{3+}\) states is crucial for maintaining high Tc values.

**Electronic Structure**: These compounds are characterized by a high density of states at the Fermi level due to the presence of Cu d-electrons. The superconductivity is believed to arise from Cooper pairing mediated by spin fluctuations within the CuO\(_2\) planes, supporting a d-wave pairing mechanism typical for hole-doped cuprates.

**Compositional Patterns**: The main compositional motif is YBa\(_2\)Cu\(_3\)O\(_{7-x}\), where the oxygen stoichiometry \(x\) is varied to optimize the hole concentration in the CuO\(_2\) planes. 

**Physical Property Correlations**: The optimal superconducting properties (higher Tc) are observed close to ideal oxygen stoichiometry (around 6.9-7.0). Deviation from this value into the under-doped or over-doped regions generally results in lower Tc values.

**Mechanistic Hypothesis**: These compounds likely exhibit unconventional superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations rather than traditional electron-phonon coupling, consistent with a d-wave pairing symmetry observed in hole-doped cuprates.

### 3) Doping analysis

- **Parent systems**: YBa\(_2\)Cu\(_3\)O\(_{7-x}\) forms the parent structure, with varying levels of oxygen doping.
- **Trends**: Generally, increasing oxygen content (reducing \(x\)) increases Tc, with optimal superconductivity typically found near \(x\approx0.1\), suggesting a critical hole doping level in the CuO\(_2\) planes. Decreasing oxygen content introduces a decline in Tc, indicating an under-doped regime.
- **Doping effects**: Hole doping is dominant, with a critical transition from under-doped to optimally doped regimes marked by increasing Tc until saturation, then decline due to over-doping effects.
- **Optimal ranges**: Maximum Tc is often reached at \(x \approx 0.1 - 0.2\), corresponding to optimal doping.

### 4) Design hints

- To explore new candidates within this family, focus on precise control of oxygen stoichiometry in synthesis to achieve optimal doping.
- Experiment with substituting La with different rare-earth elements while maintaining the structural integrity and optimizing d-orbital filling.
- Investigate the effects of external pressure or strain on YBCO-like structures to explore enhanced superconducting properties.
