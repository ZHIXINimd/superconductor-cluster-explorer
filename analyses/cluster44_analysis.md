### 2) Why this cluster groups together

The compounds in this cluster predominantly belong to the family of hole-doped cuprates, specifically the Y-Ba-Cu-O (YBCO) type superconductors. These materials typically share a layered perovskite structure, characterized by copper-oxide (CuO2) planes that are crucial for their superconducting properties. The superconductivity is facilitated by a combination of the copper-oxide layers and the presence of charge reservoir layers such as the rare-earth elements (Eu, Gd, Y, etc.). These charge reservoir layers help in achieving optimal doping levels necessary for high Tc superconductivity. The typical structure consists of Cu atoms coordinated in a square-planar geometry, often forming quasi-2D planes that allow for significant electron pairing interactions, a hallmark of d-wave symmetry in unconventional superconductors.

Chemically, these materials involve a mix of ionic and covalent bonding — primarily covalent within the CuO2 planes and more ionic character between the planes. These interactions give rise to a rich electronic structure, where the Cu d-electrons and oxygen p-states play significant roles, leading to Fermi surface topology that promotes superconducting pairing. The combination of high Fermi surface density of states with strong electron correlations and spin fluctuation are key to their superconducting mechanism.

### 3) Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)

The parent systems are primarily based on the EuBa2Cu3O7 compound, with variations achieved by substitution primarily at the Eu site. Common dopants include Pr, Gd, Sr, and Ca. 

- Pr substitution: Increasing Pr content generally reduces Tc, indicating a suppression effect in this cluster.
- Sr and Ca substitution for Ba appears to modify the Tc less predictably but generally maintains high Tc.
- Dopant ratios often indicate a decreasing trend in Tc as the level of Pr increases, with Eu0.9Pr0.1Ba2Cu3O7 being close to an optimal light doping range with higher Tc values.
  
This doping leads predominantly to hole doping because of the involvement of Pr, which is known for its mixed valence nature, disrupting the electron density within CuO2 planes. 

### 4) Design hints

- Maintain a focus on variations around the EuBa2Cu3O7 structure but consider additional charge disbalance strategies, such as slight over-stoichiometry in copper or oxygen to further stress-test the stability of Tc.
- Explore substitutions and co-dopings that might preserve high Tc values across a broader range of Pr compositions, targeting band structure features that encourage robust superconductivity.
- Investigate other rare earth substitutions, while keeping an eye on lattice matching and misfit strain, for sustained high Tc performance.
