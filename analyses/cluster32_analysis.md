### 2) **Why this cluster groups together**

The compounds in this cluster predominantly group together due to their shared electron-doped cuprate structure, where copper oxide (Cu-O) planes serve as the primary conducting layers. These materials are characterized by quasi-2D layered perovskite-like blocks, common in high-Tc superconductors. The SrCuO2-based systems, often modified by rare earth substitutions (like Nd, La, Pr), reflect a typical tetragonal structure with notable tetracopper oxide planes. Electron doping, primarily achieved through substitution in the Sr site, modifies charge carriers in the Cu-O layers, crucial for superconductivity.

Structurally, these compounds show a high level of dimensionality reduction by adopting flat Cu-O planes, similar to other cuprate superconductors. The dominant bonding is covalent within the layers, while ionic interactions occur between layers, stabilizing the perovskite-like framework. The electronic structure is characterized by mixed d-electron states where electron-doping shifts the Fermi level, enhancing the density of states near the Fermi surface and improving superconductivity.

### 3) **Doping analysis**

The parent systems within this cluster predominantly include the SrCuO2 compound and its La, Nd, Y, Sm, and Pr substituted variants. Doping primarily occurs at the Sr site, introducing electron carriers to the copper oxide planes. Maximum Tc in Sr1Cu1O2 type systems is found at Tc = 110 K with Ca-doping, where substitution levels of Sr with Ca or rare earth elements like La or Nd modulate Tc. In general, increasing substitution (e.g., Ca or La for Sr) enhances Tc up to a point, after which Tc may plateau or decrease due to over-doping effects that disrupt optimal carrier density.

### 4) **Design hints**

To explore new superconducting candidates within this family, consider:
- Examining other rare earth substitutions for systematic Tc tuning, potentially using Sm, Gd, or others.
- Investigating optimal Cu-O plane distances and layer spacings to enhance electron mobility.
- Utilizing Ca as a substitution for further tuning of Tc, particularly under various atmospheres or pressures to explore structural stability confines.
