# Cluster 18 Analysis


### 1) SUMMARY TABLE

| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1       | 50          | Cu (100%), Sr (84%), La (80%), O (76%), Pb (66%)  | 24.0–41.5 | 32.84 | U3: 100% | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; similar structures to Tl and Pb-based systems |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together
The compounds in this cluster are primarily Tl- and Pb- based copper oxide (cuprate) superconductors, which are well-known for their high-temperature superconductivity. They share structural similarities such as layered perovskite-type structures, where copper-oxygen planes are critical for their superconducting properties. This quasi-2D plane structure allows for effective charge carrier mobility, essential for superconductivity. The common presence of copper and oxygen is indicative of Cu-O bond networks, crucial for the superconducting properties of cuprates. These compounds exhibit covalent bonding character in the Cu-O planes with complex mixed valence states involving Cu²⁺ and maybe partial Cu³⁺ states, facilitating charge transfer crucial for superconductivity. The predominant hole-doping is facilitated by substitutions in the charge reservoir layers, like Sr replacing Ba or La.

### 3) Doping analysis
Parent systems in this cluster mainly consist of Tl-Cu-O and Pb-Cu-O based compounds, with common doping variations involving substitutions at the La, Sr, and Ba sites. The doping trends indicate that Sr substitution or variations in the La/Sr/Ba ratios significantly impact Tc. For Tl-based systems, Ba/Tl compositions modify the Tc, peaking around intermediate doping levels. Pb-based systems, such as Pb2Sr1La1Cu2O6+x, show Tc sensitivity to Sr and La doping, decreasing Tc with increased doping beyond optimal levels (e.g., overdoping). Optimal doping generally occurs at specific stoichiometric ratios that tune the hole carrier concentration in the Cu-O planes.

### 4) Design hints
To discover new candidates within this family, one could explore:
- Varied doping at Sr and Ba sites.
- Investigating other elements within the Lanthanide series as potential substitutes for La to manipulate hole concentration.
- Examining cage size variations by introducing ions or doping that effect lattice parameters and subsequently Tc.
- Optimization of oxygen content to balance charge transfer and enhance superconductivity.
