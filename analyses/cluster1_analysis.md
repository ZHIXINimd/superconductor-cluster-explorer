| Cluster1 | 64          | H (100%), Fe (98%), As (90%), O (75%), La (27%) | 20.0–147.0   | 40.5        | P7: 89%, C7: 6%, C6: 5%                 | Primarily doped topological insulators (LaFeAs-based); presence of hydrides (H3S) contributing to high Tc. |

### 2) **Why this cluster groups together:**

   - **Structural Analysis:** The dominant structural motif among these compounds is the layered arrangement, commonly found in the iron pnictides like the 1111 structure (LnFeAsO) and similar structures with hydrogen incorporation (LnFeAsOH). These structures typically feature alternating conducting FeAs layers and charge reservoir layers enhanced by the presence of oxygen or hydrogen.

   - **Chemical Bonding:** Bonding in these materials is mainly covalent within the FeAs layers, with some ionic character contributed by rare-earth and hydrogen bonds. The inclusion of hydrogen, often substituting or complementing oxygen, points to hydrogen bonding enhancement in these superconductors.

   - **Electronic Structure:** Shared electronic characteristics include the high density of states at the Fermi energy, influenced by the Fe 3d electron bands, which favor superconductivity through possibly unconventional pairing mechanisms. The hydrides likely show features of enhanced electron-phonon coupling.

   - **Compositional Patterns:** Most compounds have stoichiometry that mirrors doped LaFeAsO systems, often doped with hydrogen or other small elements like fluorine, where the substitution serves to optimize the electronic properties and enhance Tc.

   - **Physical Property Correlations:** Higher critical temperatures generally correlate with optimal doping of hydrogen in the FeAs-based systems, indicating that specific substitution levels and the resulting fine-tuning of electronic structures are crucial for achieving high Tc.

   - **Mechanistic Hypothesis:** Given this clustering, an unconventional superconducting mechanism with contributions from electron-phonon coupling, potentially enhanced by the hydrogen bonds and strong hybridization in the FeAs layers, is likely. Some level of s± pairing symmetry could be hypothesized.

### 3) **Doping analysis:**

   - **Parent Systems and Common Doping Sites:** Main parents are LnFeAsO and variations like SmFeAsOH where Ln can be La, Sm, Ce, etc. Doping typically occurs at the Fe site (Co substitution) or in the anion layer (H, O).

   - **Tc Trends with Doping Level:** Hydrogen doping often sees Tc variations between 20 K to 54 K, with optimal doping near H0.3–H0.4 for La systems. Ce, Pr, and Sm variants reach higher Tc (~55 K) at similar or slightly adapted doping levels.

   - **Electron vs Hole Doping:** The data suggest electron doping as the primary mechanism, given that hydrogen and Co substitutions typically donate electrons to these structures.

   - **Optimal Ranges:** Optimal doping for the SmFeAsOH system appears around H/O ratios aligned between 0.2-0.4, producing maximal Tc responses in this cluster; overdoping reduces Tc.

   - **Doping Regimes:** Evidence suggests underdoped and optimally doped regimes with a drop-off in Tc in overdoped scenarios (observed with excessive H/O deviations).

   - **No systematic doping series identified** for some variations like Li1-yFe2+ySe1, although iron and hydrogen content variability tunes Tc variably around 30-42 K.

### 4) **Design hints:**

   - Explore fine-tuning of hydrogen content alongside light-metal dopants to balance charge transport and structural integrity in LnFeAsOH systems.
   
   - Use mixed-valency control by partial substitution in the Fe or As sites, allowing stable electronic phases conducive to higher Tc.
   
   - Investigate other f-electron rare-earth elements for substitutions, probing deeper into hybridization effects unexplored here.
   
   - Prioritize structures allowing stable hydrogen incorporation, potentially by improving synthesis methods for hydrogen blending.
