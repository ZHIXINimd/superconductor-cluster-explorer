# Cluster 42 Analysis


### 1) SUMMARY TABLE

| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements                          | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes                                         |
|---------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1       | 131         | Cu (100%), Sr (100%), Ru (65%), O (95%), Y (60%) | 20 - 81      | 40.3        | U3: 85%, U6: 10%, U9: 5% | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; YBCO-like structures |

### 2) **Why this cluster groups together**

This cluster of compounds predominantly consists of superconducting cuprate materials with a YBa\(_2\)Cu\(_3\)O\(_7\)-like structure. These compounds share a layered perovskite-type structure, with copper-oxide (CuO\(_2\)) planes responsible for conduction. Many compounds involve substitution at the copper, yttrium, or barium sites, often with transition metals or rare-earth elements, leading to a range of properties but sharing a similar crystallographic motif. Structurally, these materials are characterized by quasi-2D planes separated by charge reservoir layers, facilitating hole doping and enhancing superconductivity.

### 3) **Doping analysis (parent systems, trends, optimal ranges)**

The primary parent systems in this cluster appear to be based on the Y1Sr2Cu3O7 structure, akin to YBa\(_2\)Cu\(_3\)O\(_7\), with various substitutions at the cation sites:

- **Common Doping Sites:** Copper sites are commonly substituted with Re, W, Mo, Co, and Fe; Y or Sr sites may also undergo substitution.
- **Tc Trends:** Generally, small substitutions at the Cu site (e.g., Re, W) around 0.15–0.3 lead to optimal Tc values; 
  - For instance, Tc peaks around x=0.15 for Re and around x=0.2–0.25 for W.
- **Electron vs Hole Doping:** Hole doping dominates due to the nature of the CuO\(_2\) planes and the types of substitutions.
- **Optimal Doping Ranges:** Optimal doping often occurs at x ~ 0.15–0.3, with over-doping leading to Tc suppression.
- **Underdoped vs Optimally-doped vs Overdoped:** Overdoping beyond these ranges typically reduces Tc, while underdoped variants may not reach the full potential Tc.

### 4) **Design hints**

To explore new candidates within this cluster, emphasizing compounds that maintain the layered CuO\(_2\) plane structure is crucial. Focus on subtle adjustments using slight variations in the doping levels of known cations like Y, Sr, and substitutions in the Cu positions with elements known to affect electron correlation (e.g., Ir, Rh). Prioritize heterovalent substitutions to fine-tune electronic structures without destabilizing the lattice. Consider exploring similar structures with modifications in the reservoir layers to maintain optimal charge transfer efficiency.
