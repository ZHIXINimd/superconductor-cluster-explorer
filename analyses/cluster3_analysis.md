| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements         | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes                                 |

### 2) Why this cluster groups together

- **Structural Analysis**: The compounds in this cluster are characterized by a perovskite-like structure typical for bismuthates, featuring BO6 octahedral units with bismuth and oxygen. These compounds tend to have a close-packed, quasi-3D framework providing stability and facilitating superconductivity through lattice adjustments, such as tilting and vibrating of the octahedra.

- **Chemical Bonding**: The bonding in these compounds exhibits a mixed ionic-covalent character with significant electron-phonon coupling. The substitution of K or other alkali/alkaline earth metals can induce a metallic character required for superconductivity, while deviations from stoichiometry (as seen in oxygen content variations) indicate potential for mixed valencies.

- **Electronic Structure**: These superconductors likely exhibit notable electron-phonon interaction, crucial for mediating superconductivity in bismuthates, with shifts observed in electronic states upon doping due to changes in band structure configurations and Fermi level adaptations.

- **Compositional Patterns**: The cluster prominently features Ba-K-Bi-O systems, with notable variations in K/Ba ratios. The presence of the occasional Pb, Pr, and especially Nd/Ba replacement points towards attempts to optimize electronic properties and Tc by altering carrier concentrations and structural distortions.

- **Physical Property Correlations**: Higher Tc values are often linked to optimal substitution rates and specific oxygen content and ordering, as well as structural distortions conducive to stable electron-phonon coupling and minimized electronic bandwidth.

- **Mechanistic Hypothesis**: The superconducting mechanism involves conventional electron-phonon coupling typical of bismuthates (P1), where the alteration of electronic states by substitution and stoichiometry maximizes superconductivity potential. The role of heavy elements introduces strong spin-orbit coupling effects enhancing Tc.

### 3) Doping analysis

Common parent systems in this cluster: Ba1-xKxBiO3 types are the primary systems with varied K doping levels. Some variations include replacement of Bi with Pb or Pr, and Nd/Ba substitution in alternative forms.

- **Tc Trends**: The K doping level dominates this cluster, showing that optimal substitution occurs around x=0.4 with a peak Tc nearing 31.5 K. Beyond this doping level, Tc generally decreases, indicating a potential over-doped state.

- **Doping Ratio Effects**: The optimal Tc is at a Ba:K ratio that balances electron count and lattice distortion needs. Substitutions of Bi with Pb or Pr slightly decrease Tc, possibly due to disruptions in optimal lattice or electronic configurations.

- **Doping Type**: The doping mainly encompasses hole doping via alkali metal substitution, crucial for achieving optimal superconducting conditions.

- **Optimal Ranges**: Tc maximization appears optimal in systems with doping around x=0.4, with noted examples peaking at 31.5 K.

### 4) Design hints

For exploring new candidates, consider:
- *Focus on substitutions*: Since K doping is effective, exploring analogs with other alkali metals like Rb or Cs may shift Tc optimally.
- *Modulate lattice distortions*: Use of pressure or additional light element doping could further enhance phononic interactions.
- *Electron count strategies*: Optimal electron counts could be achieved with aliovalent substitutions that adjust existing electron counts subtly.
