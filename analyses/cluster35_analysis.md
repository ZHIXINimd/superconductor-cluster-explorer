# Cluster 35 Analysis


### 1) **SUMMARY TABLE**

| Cluster | # Compounds | Top 5 Elements | Tc Range (K) | Mean Tc (K) | Family Distribution | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1       | 63          | Hg (95%), Ba (95%), Cu (95%), O (95%), Tl (10%) | 20–98    | 74.5        | U3: 100%             | Mainly hole-doped cuprates; Hg-based variants |

### 2) **Why this cluster groups together**

The compounds in this cluster are grouped together due to their common structural and chemical motifs associated with high-temperature superconductivity in mercury-based cuprate systems. These are primarily HgBaCuO-type hole-doped cuprates characterized by layered perovskite structures with copper oxide planes that play a critical role in their superconducting properties. The presence of quasi-2D CuO₂ planes facilitates strong electron interactions crucial for high-Tc superconductivity. The Hg atoms often act as charge reservoirs, modulating the hole concentration within the CuO₂ planes. This relationship creates favorable conditions for superconductivity by tuning the oxidation state of copper, promoting optimal electron pairing interactions. Chemically, the compounds share mixed-valent Cu²⁺/Cu³⁺ environments, reinforcing the required hole doping levels.

### 3) **Doping analysis**

- **Parent Systems**: The main parent system in this cluster is HgBa₂CuO₄, with variations in oxygen content.
- **Dopant Sites and Effects**: Doping involves modifying oxygen stoichiometry, with Hg often partially replaced by Tl, Cd, or doping by Zn. 
- **Trends**: The highest Tc is observed near an ideal oxygen content, optimized around 0.1-0.2 extra oxygen atoms per formula unit (e.g., HgBa₂CuO₄₊ₓ with x~0.1-0.2). 
- **Optimal Doping**: Peak Tc values occur in the optimally doped regime, typically around x=0.1-0.15, where the oxygen stoichiometry supports sufficient hole concentration in the CuO₂ planes.
- **Doping Impact**: Increasing doping from under-doped (low x) to optimally-doped (x=0.1-0.2) raises Tc peaking near 98 K, after which further doping into the over-doped regime reduces Tc.
- **Hole Doping Analysis**: The dominance of hole-doping through oxygen variation indicates a BCS-type mechanism with hole-mediated pairing.

### 4) **Design hints**

To explore new superconducting candidates within this family, consider:
- Fine-tuning the oxygen content for precise control over hole doping levels.
- Exploring substitution on the Hg site with other heavy metals (like Tl) or rare earths to modulate charge distribution without destabilizing the CuO₂ planes.
- Focus on stabilizing higher oxidation states of Cu by slight aliovalent doping, which could lead to increased Tc.
- Systematically varying chemical pressure by substituting Ba with slightly smaller or larger cations.
